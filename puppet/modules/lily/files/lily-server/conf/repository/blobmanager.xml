  <!--  BlobIncubatorMonitor : Monitors the BlobIncubatorTable and cleans up any unused (stale) blobs. These are
                               blobs which were uploaded, but not actually used in records.

        minimalAge : The minimal age (in seconds) an unused blob needs to have before it gets deleted

        monitorDelay : The time (in milliseconds) to pause between individual blob checks.
                       This is used to control the load the BlobIncubatorMonitor generates on the system.
                       This should be a small value, e.g. if you take 20ms this means at most 50 expired
                       blobs can be handled per second (assuming a block check takes 0ms).

        runDelay : The minimal time (in seconds) between two runs of the monitor.

  <!--  The BlobManager can store blobs in three different BlobStores : "HDFS", "HBASE" and "INLINE"
        Depending on the size of the blob it is stored on Hdfs, in a dedicated HBase table or inside the blob field of the record.
        The upper limits for the blob sizes can be configured below.
        The default blobstore stores all blobs that are bigger than the biggest limit, this a mandatory setting.
        The other limits are configured by giving the store's "name" and its upper "limit"
