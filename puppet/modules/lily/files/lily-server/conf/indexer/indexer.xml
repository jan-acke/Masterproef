    The amount of message queue listeners (index updaters) that should be

    Since an index updater spends some time waiting on I/O, indexing will
    go faster when running multiple index updaters in parallel on each Lily
    node.

  <!--
    Should a lock be taken so that the same record cannot be indexed concurrently by different
    indexers? This locking is based on ZooKeeper.

    We removed most cases where this locking was necessary (to assure newer content was not
    overwritten with older content in the index). The only case where there is still a need
    for this lock (to avoid the possibility of overwriting newer indexed data with older) is
    when performing a full rebuild of an index for which incremental indexing is also
    enabled. But in that case, the chance for contention seems to be quite small, so it
    seems like overkill to permanently perform locking for this purpose. We hope to eventually
    have another solution for this case, so that this locking becomes completely unnecessary.
