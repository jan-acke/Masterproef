The scripts in this directory have the following requirements:

You must have installed the mcollective-client, available as a package from 
http://apt.puppetlabs.com or in ubuntu >natty built-in:
apt-get install mcollective-client
If it asks for the hostname of the stompserver, fill in the hostname of 
the puppetmaster.

You must have correcty configured the /etc/mcollective/client.cfg file, 
most notably stomp.host, username and password must be set, see setup.yml
for those values, stomp.host is the hostname of the puppetmaster.

You must also have installed the mcollective service agent plugin from:
https://github.com/puppetlabs/mcollective-plugins/tree/master/agent/service/ .
Copy the files to the plugin directory (defined by libdir in 
/etc/mcollective/client.cfg, default on ubuntu: 
/usr/share/mcollective/plugins/mcollective). Put each file in the corresponding
directory, you might have to create the spec directory.



Some extra info about the commands:
mco service -C cdh3::zookeeper hadoop-zookeeper-server start
this consists of the following:
* service: we use the service plugin
* -C option filters the nodes based on puppet classes, in this case 
  only nodes with the cdh3::zookeeper puppetclass will be accessed
* name of the service
* command of the service (can be (re)start,stop or status)


Instead of -C you can filter nodes based on facts using -F, the current setup 
doesn't use these.

To get an overview of all the classes and facts on a certain node:
mco inventory <hostname>
